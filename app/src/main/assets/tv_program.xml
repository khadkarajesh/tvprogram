            Documentary portrait of soul, jazz and R''n''B singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, whose
            untimely death in July 2011 followed a well-publicised history of drugs and alcohol

            footage shot by friends and family, archive television clips, plus voiceover interviews
            with those who were personally and professionally close to her. Contributors include

            (1/2) A look back at the series of events that shaped the monarchy between 1936 and
            1952, using dramatic reconstructions and an extraordinary archive of film. Edward
            VIII''s abdication in 1936 meant that his brother ?Bertie'' became King George VI, and
            his eldest daughter Elizabeth was now suddenly and unexpectedly heir to the throne. When
            the Second World War broke out, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret moved into the safe
            haven that was Windsor Castle, which Elizabeth loved for its history and its heritage,
            while for Margaret it was one big adventure playground.

            (1/2) The concluding episode examines the importance of two women who enter the two
            Queen''s lives; Mary, Queen of Scots and Diana, Princess of Wales. When these two young
            women join the Royal circle, they are expected to be great additions to the court, but
            in both cases, it starts to become clear that Mary and Diana''s enormous popularity,
            beauty and sparkle are in sharp contrast to the duty-bound queens.

            (2/5) Rob Bell heads to Norfolk to follow a lost railway through some of the quietest -
            yet wealthiest - parts of the country. This railway was a curious latecomer when it was
            built in the 1880s and it threatened to rudely thrust the region into the industrial
            age. Rob explores an entire engineering town built from scratch, learns how Norfolk''s

            and natural beauty, beginning with a trip from Inverness to Edinburgh. Not long after
            setting out, the route passes Culloden, the site of the last pitched battle on British
            soil. It then enters the Cairngorms National Park, home to some of Europe''s finest
            landscapes as well as valleys steeped in Gaelic folklore. The park''s station at

            before arriving in Scottish capital Edinburgh, admired for its architecture and annual

            (2/7) Julian Norton and his practice partner Peter Wright have to cope with night-time
            emergencies, as Julian performs outdoor surgery on a first-time mum and Peter examines a
            cat with a potentially life-threatening condition. Newly qualified vet Esme Telfer
            performs her first emergency caesarian at the Skeldale practice, while at Green''s farm
            Treacle the calf falls ill and it is touch-and-go whether she will survive. Later, a
            pack of bloodhound pups causes chaos in the surgery.

            (8/3) Ben journeys to Ireland''s rugged Atlantic coastline in the winter to stay with
            Judith, an 80-year-old widow who rejected a modern way of life for one closer to nature.
            Ben learns how she and her late husband created a unique utopia and discovers how - even
            at an advanced age - she is determined to remain alone in the wild. Ben joins his

            (6/28) Patients include an anxious young man who, having avoided having a vasectomy for
            a long time, has finally bitten the bullet and come in for the procedure. He attempts to

            story. Plus, a man who has been left with impetigo on his hands after being bitten and
            scratched by his cat, and a woman whose chronic pain has not improved despite seeing Dr

            (1/3) A look back at events that shaped the monarchy between 1952 and 1972, using
            dramatic reconstructions and archive film. As the royal family made Windsor its home,
            Prince Philip grew restless. The Queen assigned him as ranger of Windsor Great Park, but
            that only led to more problems. Meanwhile, Princess Margaret exhibited a wild streak to
            her character as a party animal, the Queen Mother reportedly ran up debts of £7million,
            and the papers began to print stories suggesting extramarital affairs had taken place.
